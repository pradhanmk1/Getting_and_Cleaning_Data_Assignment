#Introduction:
This document explains a project done by me as part of assignment of ONLINE Course Getting Data and Cleaning offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.com.

#Objective:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

#Data Source:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

#About the raw data:
*  The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. 
*  The activity labels are in the y_test.txt file. 
*  The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file.
*  The same holds for the training set.

#About the script and the tidy dataset:
*  Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
*  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*  creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#About the Code Book:
The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
